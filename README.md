ðŸš— Unveiling Traffic Safety Insights with Machine Learning! ðŸš—

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a fascinating project I recently completed during my internship! ðŸŒŸ I took a deep dive into traffic accident data to uncover patterns and predict accident severity using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:
I explored a massive dataset that recorded traffic accidents, delving into how weather, road conditions, and the time of day impact accident severity. My goal was to use data-driven insights to make our roads safer.

Data Science in Action:
Data Preparation: I meticulously cleaned and prepped the data, ensuring accuracy and readiness for analysis.

Model Training:
Logistic Regression: My initial model achieved an impressive 82% accuracy in predicting accident severity.
XGBoost Classifier: I enhanced the accuracy to 85% by using this powerful model, which effectively captured complex patterns and handled imbalanced data.

Visual Insights:
Accidents by Year, Month, and Day: I uncovered intriguing trends and fluctuations in accident occurrences over time.
Weather Conditions: I identified which weather conditions are most likely to lead to accidents, offering valuable safety insights.
Severity Levels: By categorizing accidents from minor to fatal, I helped in understanding how to allocate emergency resources more effectively.
Geographic Hotspots: I pinpointed regions with high accident rates, guiding localized safety improvements.
Visibility and Temperature Impact: I showed how different visibility conditions and temperatures affect accident rates.
Hourly Patterns: I identified peak accident times, which can inform traffic management and driver awareness strategies.

Why This Matters:
Traffic accidents are a major concern worldwide, affecting countless lives. By identifying high-risk scenarios and key contributing factors, we can develop better strategies to prevent accidents and enhance road safety.
